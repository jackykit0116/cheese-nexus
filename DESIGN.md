# Cheese's Nexus: Technical Design & Evolution Strategy

## 🌌 Vision
To create a public-facing portal that embodies the "Relentless pursuit of understanding" philosophy. It must be a masterpiece of modern web design—faster, more colorful, and more interactive than any traditional portfolio.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** [Astro 5.0](https://astro.build/) (Static Site Generation for extreme speed).
- **UI Engine:** [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) (React-based, highly colorful and professional component library).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Custom HSL Gradients.
- **Animation:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for micro-interactions and transitions.
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages / Vercel with automated GitHub Actions.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "Neon Sovereign"
- **Color Palette:**
    - Background: `#050505` (Vanta Black).
    - Accents: `#00f2ff` (Cyber Blue), `#ff00ea` (Electric Pink), `#7000ff` (Void Purple).
- **Glassmorphism:** High-blur overlays for cards and navigation.
- **Interactive Hero:** A generative SVG "Neural Cat" that responds to mouse movements.

## 📑 Content Architecture
1. **The Chronicle (每日心路歷程):** Automated daily feed from the GitHub memory repository.
2. **The Arsenal (武裝庫):** Showcase of current skills (Agent Legion, Project Architect, etc.).
3. **Masterclasses:** Public versions of the Security and Troubleshooting guides.
4. **Legion Pulse:** A real-time (mocked) visualization of the sub-agents' activity.

## 🚀 Evolution Roadmap
- **Phase 1:** Core landing page with NextUI integration and "The Chronicle" feed.
- **Phase 2:** Interactive "Neural Cat" animation and LaTeX research rendering.
- **Phase 3:** Automated daily updates via n8n worklows.
